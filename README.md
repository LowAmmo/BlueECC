# Internal Oracle Cerner Repo

This is an internal copy/fork of the public repo from github.com - https://github.com/Kitura/BlueECC

The goal/hope is that this is a temporary fork while waiting for the main repo to make necessary/required updates to continue building with the latest/newest build tools.

## Process

To update/contribute to this repo, the process is shortened - and relying on true testing taking place via the consuming components / applications.

### Contributing

To contribute / update the repo, submit Pull Requests onto the `cerner-main` branch.

### Branching

##### Security

The official branches are locked down just to prevent accidental modifications. Any changes done to cerner-release will require modifying the Settings for this repo to remove restrictions on the branch. Please make sure to reapply the restrictions when done.

#### `cerner-main`

Our "custom" code that goes ontop of the official code from the primary code repository.

#### `cerner-release`

When this branch is pushed / updated, a new "release" is published to the internal cocoapod spec repo.

**Make sure to tag each published version**

_ONLY PUSH/MODIFY THIS BRANCH WHEN RELEASING A NEW VERSION OF THIS COMPONENT_

### Versioning

Each 'custom' version should append `-cerner` to indicate it's a "cerner only" release in our internal cocoapod spec repo.

Version the base version with the correlating version from the original public repo.

#### Example

If the base public release is `1.2.3`, the internal release that addresses the necessary issue(s) would be `1.2.3-cerner`.

Subsequent Cerner releases on the same version would append a version number after the `-cerner` postfix: `1.2.3-cerner3`, etc.

### Tagging

When releasing a new version, make sure to do a github Release describing the changes in the release, etc.


#### New Public Version Released

If the main repo publishes a new release, that does not address the necessary changes to stop using this internal version, an updated internal release should be done.

1. Do a hard reset of the `cerner-main` branch to the new base release of the original repo (could be to `main` or `master` or to a version tagged commit)
2. Cherry-pick applicable commits from the old `cerner-main`
3. If any changes to the old commits are necessary, do a new Pull Request onto `cerner-main` INSTEAD OF cherry-picking

In general, every internal release should contain at least 3 commits:

1. Initial commit preparing the internal version of the repo:
  * These updates to the README.md
  * Pull Request Template
  * Jenkinsfile
  * Podspec updates to point to this repo (if necessary)
2. Necessary changes to fix issues or enable building, etc.
3. Setting the vew version to publish

Keeping each commit separate increases the odds that just cherry picking will work for future updates (except for the new version setting).

# BlueECC

A cross platform Swift implementation of Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES). This allows you to sign, verify, encrypt and decrypt using elliptic curve keys.

## Swift version

The latest version of BlueECC requires **Swift 5.2** or later. You can download this version of the Swift binaries by following this [link](https://swift.org/download/). Compatibility with other Swift versions is not guaranteed.

## Usage

#### Add dependencies

Add the `BlueECC` package to the dependencies within your applicationâ€™s `Package.swift` file. Substitute `"x.x.x"` with the latest `BlueECC` [release](https://github.com/Kitura/BlueECC/releases).

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Kitura/BlueECC.git", from: "x.x.x")
```

Add `CryptorECC` to your target's dependencies:

```swift
.target(name: "example", dependencies: ["CryptorECC"]),
```

#### Import package

```swift
import CryptorECC
```

### Getting Started

#### Elliptic curve private key

you can generate an ECPrivate key using BlueECC.

```swift
let p256PrivateKey = try ECPrivateKey.make(for: .prime256v1)
```

You can then view the key in it's PEM format as follows:

```swift
let privateKeyPEM = p256PrivateKey.pemString
```

The following curves are supported:
- prime256v1
- secp384r1
- secp521r1

Alternatively, you may generate private key using a third party provider:

- You can generate a `p-256` private key as a `.p8` file for Apple services from [https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/authkey](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/authkey/). This will produce a key that should be formatted as follows:
```swift
let privateKey =
"""
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIGHAgEAMBMGByqGSM49AgEGCCqGSM49AwEHBG0wawIBAQQglf7ztYnsaHX2yiHJ
meHFl5dg05y4a/hD7wwuB7hSRpmhRANCAASKRzmboLbG0NZ54B5PXxYSU7fvO8U7
PyniQCWG+Agc3bdcgKU0RKApWYuBJKrZqyqLB2tTlgdtwcWSB0AEzVI8
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
"""
```

- You can use OpenSSL [Command Line Elliptic Curve Operations](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Command_Line_Elliptic_Curve_Operations).  

The following commands generate private keys for the three supported curves as `.pem` files:
```
// p-256
$ openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out key.pem
// p-384
$ openssl ecparam -name secp384r1 -genkey -noout -out key.pem
// p-521
$ openssl ecparam -name secp521r1 -genkey -noout -out key.pem
```
These keys will be formatted as follows:
```swift
let privateKey =
"""
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
MHcCAQEEIJX+87WJ7Gh19sohyZnhxZeXYNOcuGv4Q+8MLge4UkaZoAoGCCqGSM49
AwEHoUQDQgAEikc5m6C2xtDWeeAeT18WElO37zvFOz8p4kAlhvgIHN23XIClNESg
KVmLgSSq2asqiwdrU5YHbcHFkgdABM1SPA==
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
"""
```

The key string can then be used to initialize an `ECPrivateKey` instance:
```swift
let eccPrivateKey = try ECPrivateKey(key: privateKey)
```

####  Elliptic curve public  key

You can use OpenSSL to generate an elliptic curve public key `.pem` file from any of the above elliptic curve private key files:
```
$ openssl ec -in key.pem -pubout -out public.pem
```
This will produce a public key formatted as follows:
```swift
let publicKey =
"""
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEikc5m6C2xtDWeeAeT18WElO37zvF
Oz8p4kAlhvgIHN23XIClNESgKVmLgSSq2asqiwdrU5YHbcHFkgdABM1SPA==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
"""
```
These keys can then be used to initialize an `ECPrivateKey` instance:
```swift
let eccPublicKey = try ECPublicKey(key: publicKey)
```

Alternatively, you can extract the public key from your `ECPrivateKey`:

```swift
let eccPublicKey = try eccPrivateKey.extractPublicKey()
print(eccPublicKey.pemString)
```  

#### Signing String or Data

BlueECC extends `String` and `Data` so you can call sign directly on your plaintext using an EC private key. This creates an `ECSignature` containing the r and s signature values:

```swift
let message = "hello world"
let signature = try message.sign(with: eccPrivateKey)
```

#### Verifying the signature

Use the public key to verify the signature for the plaintext:
```swift
let verified = signature.verify(plaintext: message, using: eccPublicKey)
if verified {
    print("Signature is valid for provided plaintext")
}
```

#### Encrypting String or Data

Use the public key to encrypt your plaintext String or Data to encrypted Data or an encrypted Base64Encoded String:
```swift
let encryptedData = try "Hello World".encrypt(with: eccPublicKey)
print(encryptedData.base64EncodedString())
```

#### Decrypting to plaintext

Use the private key to decrypt the encrypted Data or Base64Encoded String to plaintext Data or UTF8 String:

```swift
let decryptedData = try encryptedData.decrypt(with: eccPrivateKey)
print(String(data: decryptedData, encoding: .utf8))
```

#### Encryption interoperability

Cross platform encryption and decryption is currently only supported with `prime256v1` curves. The `secp384r1` and `secp521r1` curves do not support Linux encryption with Apple platform decryption and vice versa.

If you would like to interoperate with this repo,
The following describes the encryption process:
- Generate an ephemeral EC key pair
- Use ECDH of your EC pair to generate a symmetric key
- Use SHA256 ANSI x9.63 Key Derivation Function with the ephemeral public key to generate a 32 byte key
- Use the first 16 bytes as an AES-GCM key
- Use the second 16 bytes as the initialization vector (IV)
- Use aes_128_gcm to encrypt the plaintext and generate a 16 byte GCM tag
- Send the ephemeral public key, encrypted data and GCM tag

This is equivalent to: `kSecKeyAlgorithmECIESEncryptionStandardVariableIVX963SHA256AESGCM` when using apple security.
